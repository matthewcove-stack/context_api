# context_api — Intent

context_api provides compact context lookup for Brain OS:
- mirrors Projects and Tasks into Postgres
- serves fast search endpoints for the intent normaliser
- optionally runs sync scripts that pull from notion_gateway

See repo `INTENT.md` for canonical spec. This doc aligns with Brain OS gold-standard docs.
