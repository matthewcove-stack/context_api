# Phase Execution Prompt — context_api

Implement only the requested phase.

Phase 1 focus (supporting role):
- Ensure search endpoints return the minimal fields needed for Phase 1 task creation/update.
- Keep sync script deterministic and safe.

Run:
- `docker compose run --rm api pytest`

Update `docs/current_state.md` for any behavioural changes.
