# context_api — Phases

## Phase 0 (done)
- Basic mirrored data model for projects/tasks
- Search endpoints and dockerised tests
- Optional sync script scaffolding

## Phase 1 (supporting)
- Ensure search endpoints cover the fields needed by intent_normaliser for task/project resolution.
- Ensure sync script can run deterministically and safely (no partial writes).

## Phase 2 (later)
- Scheduled/automated sync
- Additional entities (clients, knowledge nodes)
